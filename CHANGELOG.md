## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0]

The first release. It is tagged only after the smoke test in [docs/smoke-test.md](docs/smoke-test.md) passes on a sandbox
GitHub repo and a sandbox GitLab project.

### Added

- The smoke test checklist, `docs/smoke-test.md`, run by hand before each release.
- The core: issue status from «Depends on», review requests, assignment by load.
- The platform adapters for GitHub (`gh`) and GitLab (`glab api`, including self-managed hosts), with a shared contract
  test run against canned responses.
- The `huddle` CLI: `labels`, `wait`, `take`, `pending`, `hook` and `doctor`, and `huddle.json` with its schema.
- The templates: the Huddle block for `CLAUDE.md`, the Issue and PR templates, the GitHub labels workflow and the GitLab
  CI job.
- The skills `/huddle-setup`, `/huddle-start`, `/huddle-issue`, `/huddle-review` and `/huddle-decide`, and the
  SessionStart hook.
- The public docs: README with a quickstart for GitHub and for GitLab, roles, first day, team guide and GitLab notes.
